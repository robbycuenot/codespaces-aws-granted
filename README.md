# codespaces-aws-granted

This repository contains a basic Github Codespaces configuration that is purpose-built for AWS Control Tower / SSO Organizations. The goal is to go from clicking "Create Codespace" to working in the target AWS account / role with the fewest actions possible, while maintaining security best-practices.

This repo leverages the tool [common-fate/granted](https://github.com/common-fate/granted)
